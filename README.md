# supply_chain

## üå± Project Overview

As part of the Encode Solana/Rust Bootcamp, we built a **decentralized supply chain traceability system** using Solana blockchain technology. This project enables immutable tracking of specialty products from origin to consumer, addressing critical issues like:

- Lack of transparency in traditional supply chains
- Fraud risks
- Ethical compliance challenges
- Difficulty in product origin verification

**Key Features:**

- Immutable product history tracking
- QR code-based consumer verification
- Real-time stakeholder access
- Smart contract-based provenance verification

## üß∞ Technical Stack

- **Blockchain:** Solana (Anchor framework)
- **Frontend:** Next.js + Tailwind CSS + React
- **UI Library:** [Gill](https://gill.site/)
- **Development Tools:** [create-solana-dapp SDK](https://github.com/solana-developers/create-solana-dapp)
- **Smart Contracts:** Rust (Anchor)
- **Wallet Integration:** Solana Web Wallet

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Anchor Setup

```bash
pnpm run setup
```

> This creates a new keypair, updates Anchor config, and syncs the program ID

### 3. Build & Run

```bash
pnpm anchor-build
pnpm anchor-localnet
```

### 4. Testing

```bash
pnpm anchor-localnet
pnpm anchor-test
```

### 5. Deployment

```bash
pnpm anchor deploy --provider.cluster devnet
```

### 6. Sart the Web App

```bash
pnpm dev
```

> React app with Solana program client integration

### 7. Build the Web App

```bash
pnpm build
```

> - Next.js frontend

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements & Enhancements

### üß© Customer Onboarding

- **Customizable Workflows**  
  Tailor the platform for different industries (agriculture, manufacturing, etc.) with configurable tracking rules and compliance checks.  
  Example: Auto-assign product categories, set required tracking parameters, and define stakeholder access levels.

- **Batch Tracking System**  
  Group-track multiple products for raw material traceability:
  - Track multiple SKUs in a single shipment
  - Maintain cross-referenced data for inventory management
  - Enable B2B supplier verification through shared product metadata

### üí≥ Integrated Payment Solutions

- **On-Chain Transactions**  
  Implement direct Solana-based payments for:
  - Product purchases
  - Service fees
  - Royalty splits

- **Smart Contract Escrow**  
  Automate fund release with conditions:
  - Payment upon delivery confirmation
  - Escrow for quality assurance compliance
  - Automated refunds for non-conformance

### üåç Advanced Location Tracking

- **Real-Time Geolocation**
  - GPS/Bluetooth tracking for goods in transit
  - Integration with logistics APIs for route optimization
  - Historical location analytics for audit purposes

- **Geofencing Alerts**
  - Zone-based notifications for entry/exit events
  - Customizable alert thresholds (e.g., proximity to customs checkpoints)
  - Integration with IoT sensors for temperature/humidity tracking

### üìä Automated Quality Assurance

- **IoT Sensor Integration**
  - Temperature, humidity, and shock sensors for cold chain monitoring
  - Light exposure tracking for sensitive products
  - Automatic alerts for deviation from storage conditions

- **Data-Driven Insights**
  - Generate quality reports with sensor data visualization
  - Predictive analytics for spoilage risk
  - Compliance tracking for regulatory standards

### üì± Enhanced User Experience

  - Customizable views for farmers, manufacturers, and consumers
  - Real-time notifications for status updates
  - Exportable audit trails for compliance reporting

- **Mobile Optimization**
  - Native mobile app for on-the-go tracking
  - QR code scanning for instant product verification
  - Offline data sync with automatic upload capabilities

### üß† AI & Analytics Integration

- **Predictive Analytics**
  - Forecast supply chain bottlenecks
  - Identify patterns in product quality trends
  - Optimize logistics routes using historical data

- **Automated Compliance Checks**
  - Real-time validation against industry standards
  - Generate audit-ready reports with one click
